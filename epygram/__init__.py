"""
Enhanced Python for Graphics and Analysis of Meteorological fields
------------------------------------------------------------------

``epygram`` is a package of classes, designed to handle Meteorological Fields,
and various resource Formats from which the Fields can be extracted.

It is distributed along with a series of applicative tools using the package,
that can be used 'as is', or can be taken as templates for building more complex
applications with the ``epygram`` package.

The package uses extensively the ``footprints`` package (included in epygram
distributions), designed by the VORTEX team (MF) in order (basically) to tackle
once-for-all with Factories for families of similar classes. The basic idea
behind this concept is that similar classes have a similar set of attributes,
but with behavioral differences (values or name/number of attributes), viewed
as their "footprint".

For the needs of the FA, LFI & LFA formats and spectral transforms of fields
from ARPEGE/ALADIN/AROME models, the :mod:`arpifs4py` library is needed. It is also
therein included, already compiled for Mageia4 platforms, and with necessary
stuff for recompiling it on other platforms. Be aware to be recompiled, this
library needs an *arpifs* pack pre-compiled with *gmkpack*, and *gribex*
library.

Complete dependencies to be found in :ref:`Dependancies <dependancies>`.

It is recalled that packages available on Pypi.org can be installed locally
using: ``pip[2|3] install --user <packagename>``
